# What is the equation for linear regression?
y = a + bx + e 

where a is intercept

b is slope of line 

e is error term

# What modelling technique should you use if your variable is continuous?
Linear regression

# What is the most common method to obtain the best fit line of a linear regression?
Least Square method. It minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical deviation from each data point to the line.

# Why is the values of the Least Square method absolute?
The vertical deviation from each data point to the line is first squared, which turns negative into positive values.
