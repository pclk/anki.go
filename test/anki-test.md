## Front
What is the equation for linear regression?

## Back
y = a + bx + e 

where a is intercept

b is slope of line 

e is error term

# Note

## Front
What modelling technique should you use if your variable is continuous?

## Back
Linear regression

# Note

## Front
What is the most common method to obtain the best fit line of a linear regression?

## Back
Least Square method. It minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical deviation from each data point to the line.

# Note

## Front
Why is the values of the Least Square method absolute?

## Back
The vertical deviation from each data point to the line is first squared, which turns negative into positive values.
